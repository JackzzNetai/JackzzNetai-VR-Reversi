# VR-Reversi

## Usage
WebXR VR Reversi game for Oculus Touch (Rift, Rift S, Oculus Quest 1 and 2) controllers using AFRAME.

## Functionality
### On PC

1. Click at a valid grid to place a piece. Pieces that need to be flipped will be flipped automatically.

2. Click at a piece to manually flip it.

### On Oculus Touch (with VR mode):

*Only the right controller is usable.

1. Press and release the trigger when aiming at a valid grid to place a piece.

2. Press and release the trigger when aiming at a piece to manually flip it.

3. Press A(B) button to move the board down(up) by 1, or pull(push) the thumbstick close(far) to move the board down(up). Note: Try not to use the thumbstick to move the board across the floor level, which can cause unexpected bugs (e.g. pieces floating in the air).

4. Press the thumbstick to bring everything back to their default coordinates. This can be used to fix the bug described in 3.

5. Release the grip button when aiming at a piece on the board to remove the piece.

6. Press and release the trigger when aiming at the turn indicator (at top left corner) to pass one's turn manually.

7. Press the grip button when aiming at the piece containers (at bottom right corner) to start dragging the container. Release the grip button while hovering over a grid to drop a piece manually. This action will overwrite the piece that located at the grid if there was one.
